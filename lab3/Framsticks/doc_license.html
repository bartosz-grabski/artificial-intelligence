<h3 align=center>LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR THE <a href="http://www.frams.alife.pl/" target="_blank">FRAMSTICKS</a> SOFTWARE</h3><BR>

<p>FRAMSTICKS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED. THE USER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF THIS
SOFTWARE AND ANY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM IT.

<p>Two Framsticks applications are distributed as shareware: 
<ul>
<li>Framsticks Graphical User Interface for Windows,
<li>Framsticks Theater (for Windows, Linux, and IRIX).
</ul>
You are entitled to use each of them for a month for evaluation purposes. If you want to continue
to use them, or you want to use these shareware applications commercially, you should 
register them.

<p>However, you are allowed to use these shareware applications for unlimited period of time 
without registration, if you use them for education (learning,
teaching) or research purposes. In this case you have to be an employee 
or a student of an academic institution. As such, you are entitled 
to obtain and use the "EDU" (educational) discounted licenses.
<i>Your support is appreciated!</i>

<p>You may give copies of unregistered shareware versions
to other people for free, as long as no file is changed and no file is omitted. 

<p>If you are a registered user, you are entitled to use the registered shareware applications for your 
own use. You must not give away your personal registration code. 
Doing so will result in an infringement of copyright, and may subject you
to legal prosecution and personal liability.
